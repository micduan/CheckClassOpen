### This is just a script for me to run so I don't have to manually check if the course I want to get into is open
and I might lose it on my computer so I'm just storing it here

#### Mini todo list for the future (right now the script does all I need it to):

* add tutorials
* add multiple classes at once
* all lectures (just to get into class)
* add notification for mac from cmd
* after class is found open, automatically open chrome
